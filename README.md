# KFChess - Professional Real-time Multiplayer Chess ♕

## Overview
A professional-grade, real-time multiplayer chess game with comprehensive testing suite. Built with clean architecture principles and industry best practices.



## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Client-Server WebSocket Architecture**
- **Chess Server** (`chess-server/`) - WebSocket-based game server
- **Chess Client** (`chess-client/`) - Swing-based GUI client
- **Real-time Gameplay** - No turn restrictions, simultaneous player actions

### **Core Components**
```
Client Side:
├── ClientGame - Main game logic and GUI
├── ClientCommandSender - WebSocket command transmission
├── ClientCommandProcessor - Server response handling
└── KeyboardCommandConverter - Input to command conversion

Server Side:
├── ChessServerMain - WebSocket server
├── ServerChessLogic - Game validation and state
├── ServerCommand - Command parsing and validation
├── ClientHandler - Individual client connection management
├── ServerMessageBroadcaster - Multi-client message distribution
└── ServerConfig - Configuration management with reconnection logic
```

## 🧪 Professional Testing Suite

### **Testing Framework**
- **JUnit 5.9.3** - Modern testing framework
- **Mockito 5.4.0** - Mocking and dependency isolation
- **AssertJ 3.24.2** - Fluent assertions for readable tests

### **Test Coverage**
```
Total Tests: 25
├── Client Tests: 14
│   ├── KeyboardCommandConverterTest (7 tests)
│   └── ClientCommandSenderTest (7 tests)
├── Server Tests: 9
│   └── ServerChessLogicTest (9 tests)
└── Integration Tests: 2
    └── ProjectTestSummaryTest (2 tests)
```

### **Test Categories**

#### **Client Tests**
- ✅ Keyboard input conversion (WASD, Arrow keys, JUMP)
- ✅ Command queuing and transmission
- ✅ Player-specific command filtering
- ✅ WebSocket communication mocking
- ✅ Thread safety validation

#### **Server Tests**
- ✅ Real-time command validation (no turns)
- ✅ Simultaneous player commands
- ✅ Command parsing and classification
- ✅ Game control commands
- ✅ Movement and piece selection validation

## 🚀 Running the Application

### **Prerequisites**
- Java 11+ (tested with Java 23)
- Maven 3.6+

### **Start Server**
```bash
cd chess-server
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=chess.server.ChessServerMain -Dexec.args=8080
```

### **Start Client**
```bash
cd chess-client
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=chess.ChessClient -Dexec.args="ws://localhost:8080"
```

### **Using VS Code Tasks**
1. **Run Chess Server** - Starts the WebSocket server on port 8080
2. **Run Chess Client Updated** - Connects to localhost:8080

### **Reconnection Testing**
1. Start server and connect two clients
2. Close one client during gameplay
3. Reconnect - client will resume with original color and current game state

## 🧪 Running Tests

### **All Tests**
```bash
# Test all modules
mvn test

# Test specific module
cd chess-client && mvn test
cd chess-server && mvn test
```

### **Test Results**
```
[INFO] Client Tests: 14/14 PASSED ✅
[INFO] Server Tests: 9/9 PASSED ✅  
[INFO] Integration Tests: 2/2 PASSED ✅
[INFO] Total: 25/25 PASSED ✅
```

## 🎮 Game Features

### **Real-time Gameplay**
- **No Turn Restrictions** - Both players can move simultaneously
- **Instant Validation** - Server validates commands in real-time
- **WebSocket Communication** - Low-latency multiplayer experience
- **Advanced Reconnection System** - Players maintain their color and game state when reconnecting
- **Game State Synchronization** - Reconnecting players receive full game history to sync to current position
- **Responsive UI Design** - Game board automatically resizes with window (90% scaling)

### **Controls**
- **Movement**: WASD keys or Arrow keys
- **Jump**: Spacebar (strategic repositioning)
- **Select**: Mouse click or number keys (0-7)
- **Action**: Enter key for select/move operations

### **Professional Features**
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Comprehensive logging system
- Robust error handling
- Thread-safe command processing
- Configurable server ports
- **Smart Reconnection Logic** - Players keep their original color (WHITE/BLACK) when reconnecting
- **Game State Recovery** - Complete move history replay for reconnecting players
- **Dynamic Player Management** - Server tracks individual player connections vs. game state
- **Responsive Design** - UI adapts to window resizing with percentage-based scaling
